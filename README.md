# UFO Sightings: An Analysis using Javascript
## Overview of the analysis
### *Purpose*
The purpose of this analysis was to build a dynamic website to showcase data concerning UFO sightings across the United States. The main feature of the website would be a search engine that would allow users to filter the site's record table according to a specific date, city, state, country and UFO shape. 
## Results
### *How does the website work?*
In reality, the website works in a very simple manner. Upon entering the site (which can be viewed through the following domain: https://rrantxa.github.io/UFOs/), the first thing you'll notice is a general description of the project, which is to showcase relevant data concerning UFO sightings.
